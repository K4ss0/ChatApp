User log in
    Keystroke listener for "Enter" key to save username
    log in grants access to chat channel
    if you dont have a saved username it redirects to log in page with an alert
    once log in is complete populate channels on welcome page
    username will need to be saved temporarily while program is active
    build a log in controller
    build a log in service
    build a user name object

Chat channel page
    channel 1: general chat
    channel 2: private chat
    keystroke listen for "Enter" key to populate texts inputs
    will poll page every 500ms to refresh text on page
    can I use poll to check for new messages and save them while program is active
    will need to time stamp messages so when new user joins they wont see old messages
